<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<p>
  I’m Marko, a tech enthusiast who loves exploring new projects and trying out
  different hobbies. Whether I’m working on DIY projects, testing new recipes,
  or enjoying a meal with friends, I like keeping things fun and varied. My days
  are a mix of learning, unwinding with good food, and spending time with people
  who matter. I believe in making small improvements every day and never running
  out of things to try!
